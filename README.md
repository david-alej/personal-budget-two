# Personal Budget II

In this project, I extended my previous GitHub project called 'Personal Budget' to create a Database to keep track of data for the API, connect the API to a Database, and document the API using Swagger.This API is for a personal Budget that follows the principles of Envelope Budgeting to manage personal finnances better. In this api you can create, review, update and delete digital envelopes.
